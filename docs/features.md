## Status Legend

- ✅ **Native to OC** — OpenCode native feature, adapter uses it directly
- 🔄 **Adapted from PAI** — PAI feature translated to OpenCode events
- ⚠️ **Limited Support** — Feature available with constraints or dependencies

## What This Adapter Does

1. **Event translation** — Maps 20 PAI hook files → 9 semantic events → 7 OpenCode plugin hooks
2. **Config translation** — Converts `settings.json` to `opencode.json` format
3. **State management** — Per-session state with automatic cleanup
4. **Security validation** — Tool gating and input sanitization
5. **Compaction handling** — Dual proactive and reactive session compaction
6. **Voice notifications** — ElevenLabs TTS for task completion alerts
7. **Subagent reliability** — 4-layer suite: error detection, model fallback, stall detection, reasoning loop detection

## What This Adapter Does NOT Do

- Modify PAI source files (read-only wrapper)
- Add npm dependencies beyond TypeScript
- Auto-merge updates (human review always required)

## Subagent Reliability Suite (v0.9.1)

The adapter monitors all subagent sessions and provides automatic guidance when things go wrong. All mechanisms are fail-open — they inject warnings into system prompts but never block execution.

### Layer 1: Enhanced Error Detection

Detects provider errors in Task tool output by checking:
- Top-level `error` fields in the Task result
- Full stringified body for error patterns (rate limits, model not found, connection errors, auth failures)

### Layer 2: Actionable Model Fallback

When a provider error is detected:
- Identifies the failed `subagent_type` and its model
- Looks up the fallback chain for that role in `pai-adapter.json`
- Injects a `<system-reminder>` with specific alternative `subagent_type` suggestions and their models
- Progresses through the fallback chain on repeated failures

### Layer 3: Stall Detection

Monitors subagent activity via `message.part.updated` events:
- Tracks last activity timestamp per subagent session
- If 3 minutes pass with no activity, warns the primary agent
- Warning suggests the subagent may be hung and recommends retrying with a different model

### Layer 4: Reasoning Loop Detection

Detects when a subagent gets stuck repeating the same reasoning:
- Hashes each reasoning text chunk (via `message.part.updated` for `reasoning` parts)
- Maintains a rolling window of 8 hashes per subagent
- If 3+ identical hashes appear in the window, warns the primary agent
- Session cleanup removes all tracking state on session end
